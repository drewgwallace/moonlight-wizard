# moonlight-wizard
Automating the process of integrating Moonlight game streaming with RetroPi (emulationstation)

## Why do I want this?
You may run RetroPi and want to expand the use of its capabilities!

## Why not run on Raspbian?
RetroPi runs emulationstation, a graphical frontend that is already controller compatible.
Having the ability to navigate with a controller from boot to Moonlight streaming is convienient.

## Awesome, how do I get started?
Clone the project to your user folder, extract and run the command
    sudo pyhton moonlight-wizard.pyhton

## Are there any requirements?
The python script is targeted at versions 3.2+ , which should already by installed and ready to go!
