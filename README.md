# moonlight-wizard
Automating the process of integrating Moonlight game streaming with RetroPi (emulationstation)

## Why do I want this?
You may run RetroPi and want to expand the use of its capabilities!

## Why not run on Raspbian?
RetroPi runs emulationstation, a graphical frontend that is already controller compatible.
Having the ability to navigate with a controller from boot to Moonlight streaming is straightforward and convienient.

## Awesome, how do I get started?
Clone the project to your user folder, extract and run the command
    sudo python moonlight-wizard.py

## Are there any requirements?
The python used in this project is targeted at version 3.2+ , which should already by installed and ready to go!
